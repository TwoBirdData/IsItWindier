Recent research identified a potential turning point in global terrestrial stilling at 2010.
This investigation used global wind data to create a dataset and confirm a reversal in global terrestrial stilling using linear regression, finding an increase in windspeed of 7% from 2010 to 2020. 
The reversal was correlated with air temperature and was found to have a strong positive correlation of 0.816.
Comparisons were drawn between wind data from the UK, China and Indonesia. 
It is inconclusive whether a reversal in global terrestrial stilling is occurring in each country individually.
